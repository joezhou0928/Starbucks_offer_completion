Starbucks keeps records of their customers' demographic data, offer portfolio and transcript data including customers' transactions and offers' sending out."

    "There are all kinds of problems to be solved using the data provided. Specifically for this project, we are going to focus on building a **classification machine learning model**. As we know, Starbucks send out offers with costs, so they are interested in knowing whether one offer will be completed or not by a certain user. If one offer is predicted to be 'not completed' in the future, then Starbucks can save money by not sending out this offer. Apart from making predictions, this model can also tell us how different features impact the final prediction. "

Moreover, this is a binary classification problem, meaning that we only have two classes as our target - **True** for 'completed' and **False** for 'not completed'. Therefore, we are good to go with the simplest classification metrics - **accuracy**, which denotes the percentage of correct predictions.`"

    "1. Customers with higher income are more likely to complete an offer because they are more capable of doing so.\n",
    "2. Loyal customers are more likely to complete an offer. However, how to define a potential loyal customer is a problem itself. Maybe we should use feature engineering to create features that can reflect customers' loyalty.\n",
    "3. Demographics as well as customer behavior data can both be helpful in building our model. \n",
    "4. Offer data such as offer type, difficulty to complete and reward can be useful."

I have read in *A Collection of Data Science Take-Home Challenges* by Giulio Palombo that user behavior data can be more important than demographics. This is because any user behavior speaks for itself and more importantly reveals information on timing. That being said, let's incorportate some user behavior features into our model to see how it goes."

Although all the customers haven't completed an offer or even spent any money before, they are still predicted as 'complete'. So what happened? First, 9 customer out of 10 have an income higher than the mean/median value we saw before, so it explains. Second, for customer with index of 11286, even though he/she has a lower income, this customer became member in 2016. This is the year considered by our model as the 'loyal' year. "

If we were able to discover that, our model will improve a lot."

    "Here is a summary of key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Including customer behavior data can significantly improve the performance of machine learning model. Sometimes they are way more important than customer demographics.\n",
    "2. Our model has established its own definition of a loyal customer: having higher income, spending more money and becaming member in either 2015 or 2016.\n",
    "3. Data wrangling can be very time-consuming. Audiences are not interested in that and analysts don't like it either. However, a machine learning cannot be built without it.\n",
    "4. Our model's accuracy is about 77%. It is not bad but there is still room for improvement.\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "So, how can we improve the current model? \n",
    "1. **Use grid search.** As you may have noticed, our model is trained with default parameters. Nonetheless, grid search can help us iterate through different combinations of parameters and optimize it. Grid search is simple and often guarantees a higher accuracy but takes a lot of time to run. It should always come last when you have already successfully built something that works.\n",
    "2. **Collect more data, both in sample size and the number of features.** How larger sample size benefits machine learning doesn't need more explanation. It has been a dream for many data science people but unfortunately it is seldom realized. Having more features is more possible though. It really depends on the sense that one person has about the context, i.e. whether he/she knows a feature is useful or not. In our case, ignoring customer behavior data would limit the model performance."

    "At the end of this notebook, here are some reflections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Try using sample data when running on the whole dataset takes too long.** Due to a few loops in the data wrangling part, running this whole notebook can take more than 40 minutes. That's why I created 'subset_users' and 'subset_transcript' tables to hold sample data. With that, I was able to test my changes to functions by running the whole notebook with only a minute. But by the end of the day, make sure you have run the model using the whole data set at least once.\n",
    "2. **Stick to the best practices.** I first developed my code in a procedural manner because I didn't know what functions to have at the very beginning. Nonetheless, after I have got everything I need, I then organized them into different functions. That makes my code look cleaner and more readable. \n",
    "3. **Think of one question and answer that as well as possible.** When I saw the data set, I had a few questions in my head and tried to solve them all. Then I realized how impossible that was. Solving multiple questions might end up solving none of them. Focusing on one instead made me feel more relaxed and efficient. In real business, people don't usually have time finishing one problem well, let alone solving multiple ones at the same time.\n",
    "4. **Don't push too hard on perfection but on refinement.** Data analysis is art and science, so there is not a correct answer to a problem. Different people can arrive at different conclusions due to different approaches used. What really matters is whether one backs up the analysis with concrete evidence and logic. More importantly, one should always try refining the analysis based on the previous trials. Iterative experiment is crucial to machine learning. \n",
