# Starbucks_offer_completion
### Summary:
Once in a while, Starbucks sends out offers to their customers as a marketing strategy. Offers are of different types and every customers may receive different kinds and numbers of special offers. Starbucks keeps records of their customers' demographic data, offer portfolio and transcript data including customers' transactions and offers' sending out. Specifically for this project, we are going to focus on building a **classification machine learning model**. As we know, Starbucks sends out offers with costs, so they are interested in knowing whether one offer will be completed or not by a certain user. If one offer is predicted to be 'not completed' in the future, then Starbucks can save money by not sending out this offer. 

### Files:
There are two folders: data and code.
1. **data**: It contains a data.zip file. There are three .json files within this zip files which are the data sets for this project.
2. **code**: There are two files. One is the a jupyter notebook and the other one is the .py file exported from the notebook.

### Instructions:
1. Download all the files and put them under the same folder.
2. Within that folder, unzip the data.zip file and put all .json files under a folder called 'data'.
3. From here, you are good to go and are able to execute the python code without error. But the code may take a while (40 minutes and more) to run.

### Libraries used:
Please make sure you have these libraries pre-installed: pandas, numpy, math, json, time, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn and itertools.
